# LavMusicPlayer

A fork of [LavMusicBot](https://github.com/LOLYAY-INC/LavMusicBot) but ** replacing discord with local playback**m
intending to be like Spotify desktop or any other local music player.

# The project just started, so this is still in development.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Here are some of the features planned for future updates:

- [x] **Auto-Leave:** The bot will automatically leave the voice channel after a configurable amount of time when it's left alone.
- [x] **/lyrics Command:** A new command to fetch and display the lyrics for the currently playing song. (Using
  MusixMatch)
- [x] **Live Lyrics:** Highlight the current line of the song being played
- [ ] **Single-Guild Mode:** An option in the config to restrict the bot to operate in only one server, simplifying permissions and setup for private use.
- [ ] **DJ Role:** A configurable "DJ role" that can exclusively use music commands.
